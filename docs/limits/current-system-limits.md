# Current System Limits
Parent index: [Current Limits](./!INDEX.md)

## Purpose

This file captures the active, known constraints in the current client and server system.

## Overview

It serves as the current-limits ledger for incomplete wiring, hard caps, and intentionally unsupported behavior that still applies today.

Accepted practical ceilings that are not active bugs or roadmap work belong in [Stable Limitations](stable-limitations.md).

## Issue list or backlog

### Architecture / Networking

- No prediction/reconciliation layer is implemented beyond interpolation.
- The server is expected to be running separately for the Godot client.
- Local server launch from the Godot client is not implemented.
- The current client expects a local Go server target during development.
- Realtime candidate construction uses an approximately 1,200-byte `HardCapBytes` limit for `world_full`, ship/asteroid/bullet lifecycle, and ship/asteroid/bullet movement candidates; splittable candidates are chunked before encoding and an individually oversized record fails explicitly.
- Physical gameplay DataChannels have independent reliability and buffering, but the current server send preflight is grouped per session: if any selected lane would exceed the 32 KiB buffered-amount threshold, every gameplay packet selected for that session tick is skipped. Lane-isolated backpressure handling is not yet implemented.

#### Active client realtime receive limits

- Pre-match buffering is bounded to 4 match buckets, 128 packets and 256 KiB estimated expanded JSON per match, with a 5000 ms lifetime and oldest-bucket eviction. A selected authoritative match with lost or expired buffered state fails closed and requests world, overlay, and session recovery.
- `world_full`, asteroid lifecycle, and bullet lifecycle assembly are each bounded to 128 chunks, 16384 cumulative records, 2 MiB estimated expanded JSON, and 5000 ms lifetime.
- Limit, expiry, malformed metadata, interrupted, duplicate, mismatched, and non-contiguous failures reset incomplete client assembly state, apply no partial state, and request authoritative recovery. These are active defensive client limits, not missing work and not changes to the server's approximately 1200-byte candidate construction cap.

- `start_single_player_request` does not currently reject an already-authenticated WebSocket session at the server boundary. This is a bounded but real identity-enforcement gap, not merely a product omission: the intended identity model is still Guest or Local Profile for local single-player, and player-data mode validation rejects `single_player + authenticated_account`, but the WebSocket start-single-player path does not enforce that rejection directly yet. This must be closed before hosted/public account-enabled release shapes rely on strict Guest/Local Profile versus Authenticated Account separation.
- Vertical despawn behavior is limited by the relationship between world height, visible viewport height, and despawn margin.

### Combat Systems

- The client should not calculate damage locally.
- Client rendering from damage events is not fully implemented in the damage design path.
- `damage_over_time_started` and `damage_over_time_tick` have adapters/mapping, but active DoT gameplay ownership is not fully wired here unless the code says otherwise.
- Presentation concepts such as `shield_absorbed`, `damage_immune`, and `damage_area_applied` are not implemented unless wired elsewhere.
- Radial client visuals are not fully implemented in the radial design path.
- Torpedo radial currently targets asteroids and enemies only; players, projectiles, and pickups are excluded.
- Radial knockback is not implemented.
- Radial status effects are not implemented.
- Enemy death consequences are not fully wired yet.
- Only `basicasteroids` drop tables exist today.
- There is no minimum drop count policy yet.
- All current asteroid variants use `collision_shape = "asteroid:0"`.
- All current asteroid variants use `stats_profile = "standard"`.
- All current asteroid variants use `drop_table = "basicasteroids"`.
- Pickup health is current health only.
- Pickups have no `max_health` field.
- Bullet/pickup collision damage is not enabled.

### Rails / PostgreSQL test infrastructure

- Rails tests do **not** provision or start PostgreSQL. `services/api-server/bin/ci` invokes `bin/setup --skip-server`, and `bin/setup` runs `bin/rails db:prepare`; both assume a reachable PostgreSQL server already exists.
- Native-Windows execution of `services/api-server/bin/setup` is currently broken at its child `system!("bin/rails db:prepare")` call because the shebang-based `bin/rails` script is not directly executable by the Windows process API (`Errno::ENOEXEC`). WSL/Linux is the normal supported path; on native Windows the equivalent setup must currently be invoked explicitly through Ruby/Bundler.
- The Rails test helper uses `parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)`. On native Windows this attempts process-based parallelization and fails because Ruby does not implement `fork()`. A single-worker run can be forced with `PARALLEL_WORKERS=1` for local diagnosis.
- After forcing a single worker, OpenAPI contract tests currently fail on native Windows because the contract helper passes a `C:/.../shared/contracts/http/` filesystem path through URI handling that expects an absolute URI path. During the 2026-08-16 corpus qualification this produced 52 errors across 175 tests, with 0 assertion failures before those path errors.
- The main `.github/workflows/ci.yml` currently has no Rails/PostgreSQL job or PostgreSQL service container, so the Rails suite is not part of the ordinary repository CI gate.
- Local database environment and the running PostgreSQL instance must agree on host/port. During the 2026-08-16 qualification, the repo-local `.env` specified port 5432 while the actual local PostgreSQL 18 service was listening on 5433. This configuration drift can masquerade as a Rails/PostgreSQL failure and must be reconciled before relying on local API tests.
- `db:prepare` cannot repair a completely absent test database in the affected native-Windows setup when libpq reports the missing database as a generic `PG::ConnectionBad`. The configured `space_rocks_api` role does have `CREATEDB`; explicitly creating `space_rocks_api_test` allowed `RAILS_ENV=test rails db:prepare` to complete successfully during qualification.

### Player Data

- Matchmaking and leaderboards are not implemented.
- The Rails API/auth path exists, but broader account product surfaces and durable progression systems are incomplete.
- Player-data schema generation is not fully implemented as a separate pipeline domain.
- Generated migration skeletons are not implemented.
- Focused stats and match-result TOML-to-Go contract tests exist, but generated player-data schema outputs and broader multi-language schema drift enforcement are not implemented.
- Live progression grants are not implemented.
- Currency, ship parts, unlocks, achievements, and loadout persistence are not implemented.
- V1 stats payloads do not include currency, ship parts, unlocks, loadouts, achievements, or match history yet.

### Client Presentation

- See [Player Build Limits](player-build-limits.md) for current ship-variant and player-build constraints.
- Weapon UI and equip presentation are not fully implemented yet.

#### Client Menu Flow

- Options is not implemented.
- Campaign is disabled in the single-player pregame menu.
- Loadout is disabled in the single-player pregame menu.
- Provisioner is disabled in the single-player pregame menu.
- Buy Scrap is disabled in the single-player pregame menu.
- Rankings are disabled in the single-player pregame menu.
- Manual login is disabled.
- Google login is disabled.
